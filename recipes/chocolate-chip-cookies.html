    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With a texture that is slightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, it’s the best chocolate chip cookie recipe</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 cup coarsely chopped nuts, if desired</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 375°F. In small bowl, mix flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>In large bowl, beat softened butter and sugars with electric mixer on medium speed, or mix with spoon about 1 minute or until fluffy, scraping side of bowl occasionally.</li>
        <li>Beat in egg and vanilla until smooth. Stir in flour mixture just until blended (dough will be stiff). Stir in chocolate chips and nuts.</li>
        <li>Onto ungreased cookie sheets, drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown (centers will be soft). Cool 2 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Store covered in airtight container.</li>
